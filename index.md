## Welcome to My Digital Garden

Hello! I'm **Jason Hutchinson**, a Lead Developer and Computer Scientist with a passion for building scalable systems, exploring compiler design, and pushing the boundaries of web technology.

### What I Do

I specialize in **Cloud Architecture** and **Full-Stack Development**. My work often involves migrating complex legacy systems to modern, serverless architectures on AWS. I love solving hard problems, whether it's optimizing database queries or designing a custom compiler for a subset of C.

### About This Site

This site serves as a portfolio of my projects, a collection of my thoughts on technology, and a resume of my professional experience. I've styled it with a **Cassette Futurism** aesthetic because I believe the future of tech should always remember the tactile, chunky, and optimistic designs of the past.

### Recent Updates
