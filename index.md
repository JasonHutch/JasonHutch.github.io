title: About Me

## Welcome

Hello! I'm **Jason Hutchinson**, a Lead Developer and Computer Scientist with a passion for building software that solves problems and doing my part in advancing the field of artificial intelligence. This site serves as a portfolio of my projects, a collection of my thoughts on technology, and a resume of my professional experience.

### What I Do

I specialize in the architecture, implementation, and deployment of scalable, backend systems. My work often includes designing scalable systems built on Azure services and carrying out the execution of these services by:

* Leveraging **C#** and **Python** to build robust REST based API's using frameworks like **.NET** and **FastAPI**
* Designing relational and non relational data stores and access patterns to ensure secure data storage and retrieval from databases like **SQL** and **Redis**
* Leveraging agent orchestration tools such as **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **LangChain** to strategically leverage LLM's to inject intelligence into the systems I design.
* Work closely with clients to understand and distill complex business challenges into solutions that deliver results in a scalable and robust way.
* Create and monitor **continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines to ensure efficient and repeatable cloud deployments.

### Research
I am currently attending the **University of Texas at Arlington** to obtain my masters in software engineering with a focus in Intelligent Systems. It is here that I am researching topics such as:
* LLM alignment and safety
* Neural Networks / Deep Learning
* Software agents and tool calling

### Recent Updates

*   **[Enterprise Cloud Migration](/posts/enterprise-cloud-migration/)**: A deep dive into a recent large-scale refactoring project.
*   **[Mini-C Compiler](/posts/compiler-design/)**: My journey into low-level code generation with LLVM.
*   **[Beyond Attention](/posts/transformers-reflection/)**: Thoughts on the future of Neural Networks.
